// Burns: {
//           "What is the cause of burns":
//             "Burns and scalds are damage to the skin caused by heat. Both are treated in the same way. A burn is caused by dry heat – by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam. Burns can be very painful and may cause: red or peeling skin. Blisters. Swelling. White or charred skin. The amount of pain you feel isn’t always related to how serious the burn is. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless. Both burns and scalds can be caused by: coming into contact with something hot, such as a flame, hot iron, oven or stove, hair straighteners or chemicals. electricity. radiation, such as sunlight, sunlamps or sunbeds. friction, for example if you fall on a carpet and burn your skin. coming into contact with a corrosive substance, such as acid. Breathing in smoke or poisonous fumes can also cause burns.",
//           "Signs and Symptoms":
//             "The symptoms of a burn depend on how serious it is. Symptoms of a minor burn include: red or peeling skin. swelling. blisters. If you have a more serious burn, you may also have: white or charred skin. patches of discoloured skin. pain that gets worse in the few days after the burn. a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above. itching. The symptoms of a scald are similar to those of a burn, but a burn may also cause your skin to char.",
//           "What to do in emergency situation":
//             "If someone has a burn, you should: Move the person away from the heat. Remove any clothing or jewellery near the burnt area of skin, including babies’ nappies. Don’t remove anything that’s stuck to the burnt skin, as this could cause more damage. Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes. Never use ice, iced water or any creams or greasy substances such as butter. Keep yourself or the person warm. Use a blanket or layers of clothing, but avoid putting them on the injured area. Cover the burn with cling film. Put the cling film in a layer over the burn, rather than wrapping it around a limb. A clean plastic bag can be used for burns on your hand. Treat the pain from a burn with paracetamol or ibuprofen. Always check the manufacturer’s instructions when using over-the-counter medication. If the face or eyes are burnt, sit up as much as possible, rather than lying down – this helps to reduce swelling.",

//         "Breathing Difficulties": {
//           "What is the cause of breathing difficulties?":
//             "Breathing difficulties can be caused by many different conditions. They can also be a symptom of a panic attack. In rare cases, breathing difficulties may be a sign of a life-threatening condition, such as a heart attack or anaphylaxis.",
//           "Signs and Symptoms":
//             "The symptoms of breathing difficulties depend on their cause. They may include: feeling breathless (you may gasp for air) wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing) a tight chest, which may feel like a band is tightening around it. not being able to take a deep breath. finding it harder to do things that are normally easy. the muscles in your neck and chest feeling tight. feeling more anxious than normal. coughing. wheezing. feeling breathless, even when you’re resting. waking up at night feeling breathless. a high-pitched sound when you breathe – this is called stridor. blue lips or skin (cyanosis).",
//           "What to do in emergency situation":
//             "If someone is having breathing difficulties, you should: Sit them down in a comfortable position and try to calm them down. Give them their medication (such as an asthma inhaler) if they have it with them. If the person doesn’t recover quickly, call 999 for an ambulance.",

//         Choking: {
//           "What is the cause of choking?":
//             "Choking is caused by a blockage in the throat, which can either be complete or partial. The blockage prevents air from reaching the lungs and can be caused by: choking on food. breathing in smoke. swallowing something harmful, such as a pill. a severe allergic reaction. a throat infection or swelling. a blocked airway. a head injury. a stroke. a condition that causes the muscles in the throat to go into spasm.",
//           "Signs and Symptoms":
//             "The signs and symptoms of choking are: coughing. gagging. wheezing. a hoarse voice. red face. blue lips. difficulty breathing – your breathing may be noisy or high-pitched. severe distress – you may be clutching your neck with one or both hands. loss of consciousness.",

//           "What to do in emergency situation":
//             "If someone is choking, you should: Encourage them to keep coughing to try to clear the blockage. Ask them to try to spit out the object if it’s in their mouth. Don’t put your fingers in their mouth to help them as they may bite you accidentally. If coughing doesn’t work, start back blows. Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between their shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts. Stand behind the person who’s choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them forward. Clench one fist and place it right above their belly button. Put the other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this movement up to five times. If the person’s airway is still blocked after trying back blows and abdominal thrusts, get help immediately: Call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Continue with the cycles of five back blows and five abdominal thrusts until help arrives.",

Don’t try to give them food or drink. Stay with them and talk to them calmly until they recover. Note how long the seizure lasts.",
